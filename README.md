# Controller

KiCad 7 design files (schematic, PCB, gerber, BOM) for a replacement PCB for the UCOM USB game controller that introduces the following features:
- ESP32 based (WiFi + Bluetooth onboard) with external (IPEX) antenna
- SPI LCD Connector
- Micro SD Card slot 
- Single cell lithium battery charger
- USB C for programming/joystick
- Onboard accelerometer + gyroscope + magnetometer (MPU9250)
- 8 analog inputs (4 pressure-sensitive buttons + 2 joysticks)
- 8 digital inputs
- Toggle switch
- Infrared TX/RX 
- RGB LED

While this board has been designed to be dimensionally identical to the original PCB, a little 'hacking' on the part of the casing to make room for the USB connector, infrared transmitter/receiver and for the mounting of the toggle switch and external ESP32 antenna.
